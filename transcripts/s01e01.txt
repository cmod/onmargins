[00:00:00.00 @craigmod] "What an astonishing thing a book is.


[00:00:04.07 @craigmod] It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny, dark squiggles.


[00:00:12.59 @craigmod] But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years.


[00:00:20.4 @craigmod] Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head directly to you.


[00:00:27.93 @craigmod] Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other,


[00:00:34.55 @craigmod] citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time.


[00:00:40.51 @craigmod] A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic." This is Carl Sagan talking about what makes books great.


[00:00:50.97 @craigmod] This is back in 1980 and what's so weirdly compelling about this quote is that the magic of a book,


[00:00:58.49 @craigmod] despite it being relatively simple as a piece of technology, I mean incredibly simple as a piece of technology,


[00:01:05.38 @craigmod] has been in no way diminished by the onslaught of smartphones and ubiquitous internet.


[00:01:11.18 @craigmod] And when we say ubiquitous internet we really mean ubiquitous internet.


[00:01:15.52 @craigmod] Go to the fields of Myanmar and you will find farmers atop buffalo playing Clash of Clans on newly minted 3G networks.


[00:01:26.49 @craigmod] Walk into any caf√©, any restaurant and you will see a sea of people looking down at their phones.


[00:01:35.9 @craigmod] In fact,


[00:01:36.7 @craigmod] our state of always-


[00:01:45.2 @craigmod] But what is a great book in its most simple definition?


[00:01:48.5 @craigmod] To me, a great book is a piece of thinking in which usually one other person who's hopefully an expert in their field


[00:01:56.47 @craigmod] or an expert of their own unique experience.


[00:01:59.5 @craigmod] And that's an important and kind of strange caveat because sometimes people have had experiences


[00:02:05.1 @craigmod] but they haven't put in the time to become experts of their own experience.

[00:02:09.08 @craigmod] And so you have this expert who has worked through a thought or a collection of thoughts over and over again.

[00:02:16.28 @craigmod] These thoughts can be textual or visual or some combination therein.

[00:02:21.49 @craigmod] A refinement of a kind of thinking about a specific topic.

[00:02:26.55 @craigmod] That thinking or experience is distilled and then given to others as a gift


[00:02:31.3 @craigmod] and I hope in a best case scenario as a starting point for a deeper kind of dialogue.


[00:02:37.61 @craigmod] I've been working on and with books for over 15 years as a designer, a publisher, a producer and an author


[00:02:46.9 @craigmod] and what I've realized over time is that the margins of a great book run deep.


[00:02:52.97 @craigmod] The more I've worked on my own books, the more I've come to realize that the white space


[00:02:57.26 @craigmod] and untold stories behind how and why a book is made are not only compelling but essential


[00:03:04.6 @craigmod] and it's within those margins that I want to spend some time.


[00:03:08.6 @craigmod] The first guest on this podcast is author Jan Chipchase whose life is nothing if not oodles of white space,


[00:03:15.96 @craigmod] oodles of untold stories and unseen preparation in anticipation of sharing his insights with the world.


[00:03:23.24 @craigmod] And so today, we're talking about his most recent book, The Field Study Handbook. My name is Craig Mod.


[00:03:29.91 @craigmod] I'm here today with Jan Chipchase and it's a very special day for Jan..


[00:03:34.81 @craigmod] He has in his hands something that he has been working on for a long, long time. Three ..


[00:03:41.9 @janchip] Yeah.


[00:03:42.06 @craigmod] Three things.


[00:03:42.71 @janchip] Three years.


[00:03:43.91 @craigmod] Three years.


[00:03:45.33 @janchip] Intensively.


[00:03:47.05 @craigmod] Super intensively. So Jan, what is this that you have in your hand and why are we talking this morning?


[00:03:52.97 @janchip] I have been working on a book called The Field Study Handbook,


[00:03:56.87 @janchip] which is a guide to running international field research.


[00:04:01.68 @janchip] Basically it's a guide to traveling around the world, decoding culture, building teams


[00:04:08.03 @janchip] and helping clients figure out how the world out there affects how they think and what they should do next.


[00:04:14.03 @craigmod] You gave me a sneak peek at this and I'm really excited about it.


[00:04:20.67 @janchip] You're in it.


[00:04:21.92 @craigmod] What? Oh man. I'm going to need some royalties on this thing now.


[00:04:26.83 @craigmod] I'm really excited about this book because your life,


[00:04:30.12 @craigmod] your work-


[00:04:37.18 @craigmod] who are designers or travelers or ethnographers.


[00:04:40.15 @craigmod] And this book is a consolidation of all of that work and thinking of your life.


[00:04:46.19 @janchip] About field work, yeah.


[00:04:48.15 @craigmod] And how long is it?


[00:04:49.62 @janchip] 524 pages..


[00:04:51.47 @craigmod] Yeah, I mean you just held it up for me. It looks like a Bible. It is definitely .. It's a weapon.


[00:04:57.86 @craigmod] You could use that to attack people..


[00:04:58.96 @janchip] It's a handbook but it's 1. .. I just measured it for the first time, it's 1.75 inches.


[00:05:04.84 @craigmod] Yeah. It's a mitt book. It's not really just for a hand, it's like for a giant's mitts.


[00:05:12.59 @janchip] For large handed people. But having said that, it does have 80 diagrams in it. It's not like all text.


[00:05:19.44 @janchip] There's 80 diagrams, there's 50 illustrations in there, also tables, case studies. It's well spaced out.


[00:05:25.47 @craigmod] Yeah, I mean what I love about it is you [inaudible 00:05:29] as this guide to doing field work, but really,


[00:05:31.49 @craigmod] I mean, looking at the table of contents and reading the bits that you let me read


[00:05:35.45 @craigmod] and just having known you for years and talk to you about your work, this book is,


[00:05:39.75 @craigmod] it's a guide to living globally in a respectful way. I think the respect component is so big in this book. I love it.


[00:05:49.35 @craigmod] I mean, you sent me these little samples and so much of the sample was about respect.


[00:05:53.85 @janchip] There's a thing in our field which is human centered design, right?


[00:05:57.64 @janchip] Putting people at the center of the process in some shape or form.


[00:06:02.65 @janchip] A lot of people talk about that as if if you practice that, that the thing that you do will turn out good.


[00:06:09.1 @janchip] As in good in the sense of be social and be good for society.


[00:06:13.67 @janchip] But actually, the reality is you can use those tools for good and bad.


[00:06:17.73 @janchip] You can make more money out of people without them realizing it.


[00:06:21.88 @janchip] You can create solutions that shift balance of power in the favor of the few instead of the many.


[00:06:28.01 @janchip] There's many different ways it can be applied.


[00:06:29.94 @janchip] Actually, the ethics of how we do this


[00:06:32.58 @janchip] and the intent behind how we do this is one of the most important parts of this process.


[00:06:39.7 @janchip] I'm sharing what I believe creates and draws in these rich and valid


[00:06:46.01 @janchip] and sustainable ways of collecting data in the world out there, and using it to make a difference.


[00:06:51.87 @janchip] Yeah, thank you for picking up on that.


[00:06:53.38 @craigmod] Yeah. I mean, it almost, and some parts of it read almost like a travel guide from the 1800s or something..


[00:06:59.72 @craigmod] I mean, it really is this ..


[00:07:01.26 @craigmod] We have this sense of the world in a globalism ironing out everything and everywhere you go it's a McDonald's


[00:07:09.31 @craigmod] and a McDonald's is a McDonald's is a McDonald's. But the reality is that they aren't all the same like that.


[00:07:14.48 @craigmod] I mean, there's a paragraph I want to just read for a second where you're talking about forms of incentive and you say,


[00:07:22.23 @craigmod] "For example, for home based sessions in China it's common to arrive with a gift such as watermelon


[00:07:26.9 @craigmod] and leave after handing over an envelope of cash. In Japan small, fancy biscuits are an appropriate gift on arrival..


[00:07:33.29 @craigmod] In communities without refrigeration ..


[00:07:34.5 @craigmod] " Which is, I love that because it's like, yeah, you're going to be in places without refrigerators sometimes.


[00:07:39.67 @craigmod] "It is better to turn up with a live animal that can be eaten in one sitting, such as a chicken.


[00:07:45.04 @craigmod] In countries where prepaid phones are common,


[00:07:46.8 @craigmod] air time is an appropriate gift that can also be converted into cash." In one paragraph


[00:07:52.36 @craigmod] and you have about a billion of these paragraphs like that.


[00:07:55.95 @craigmod] It's this quick jump deep into places and ways of thinking about places that I think most people don't get to. Kudos.


[00:08:04.86 @craigmod] I like it.


[00:08:05.4 @janchip] Thank you.


[00:08:06.31 @janchip] I've been practicing this for 17 years, now, from my first job


[00:08:12.17 @janchip] and it's a privilege every day to be doing this kind of work.


[00:08:16.51 @craigmod] Walk us through the elevator pitch of Jan's last 17 years.


[00:08:21.52 @janchip] Okay, and the preamble to that is a degree in development economics in the UK.


[00:08:27.37 @janchip] Joined a research institute at the University of Bristol.


[00:08:30.2 @janchip] Then, moved to Japan where we didn't meet, surprisingly because we were both out there.


[00:08:36.16 @janchip] I was in Japan for 10 years and I worked initially as a very bad usability engineer


[00:08:45.7 @janchip] and then morphed into concept designer. This was at Nokia's research center in Tokyo.


[00:08:52.89 @janchip] Then, eventually made my way up to being principal scientist in the research center.


[00:08:58.13 @janchip] Then, in 2000 I left and I became a executive creative director of global insights, long job title.


[00:09:07.55 @janchip] Overseeing the research practice at Frog Design, globally.


[00:09:10.94 @craigmod] You left Nokia 2000.


[00:09:13.55 @janchip] 2010. I was at Nokia 2000 to 2009. actually.


[00:09:18.65 @craigmod] Then, 2009 you joined Frog.


[00:09:22.1 @janchip] 2010 I joined Frog, I think.


[00:09:24.24 @craigmod] 2010. I mean, you were there in the Nokia heyday, like when Nokia was a real company, it wasn't gutted.


[00:09:30.69 @janchip] Yeah.


[00:09:31.45 @craigmod] You said, if you said a Nokia, I mean that was essentially what is synonymous,


[00:09:37.23 @craigmod] it was like Kleenex for tissues. Nokia is a phone.


[00:09:39.99 @janchip] Pretty much, yeah. At that time I was there I joined just at the peak of their insane valuation.


[00:09:49.08 @janchip] If you look at any market capsize valuation you'll see a chart that looks Everest-


[00:09:55.44 @janchip] and I joined just at the peak of the Everest-


[00:09:59.36 @craigmod] Hopefully you got paid only in options.


[00:10:02.14 @janchip] I got paid in love and elk biscuits of something.


[00:10:06.69 @craigmod] Yummy.


[00:10:07.81 @janchip] Then I worked on emerging markets.


[00:10:11.18 @janchip] Products that essentially, at that time, were being sold for about $70 dollars and they went down to about $35 dollars.


[00:10:16.22 @janchip] These days those products you can probably get new for about $15 dollars on the market.


[00:10:21.74 @janchip] When the mobile phone went from being niche and very expensive, to becoming a mass consumer product.


[00:10:28.46 @janchip] I was there during the heyday of that,


[00:10:30.13 @janchip] and was fortunate enough to have done work that influenced the direction of that.


[00:10:34.83 @janchip] Part of those stories are in the book as well.


[00:10:36.63 @craigmod] I mean, and a lot of this was in, it wasn't in America, it was in deep China, it was in deep India.


[00:10:43.87 @janchip] Absolutely. Yeah.


[00:10:45.12 @craigmod] Right?


[00:10:45.43 @janchip] Yeah.


[00:10:45.94 @janchip] I was based out of Tokyo, but I spent pretty much for the last 17 years I've spent half the year,


[00:10:51.59 @janchip] up to half the year traveling the world and specializing in what was then called emerging markets.


[00:10:57.63 @janchip] I think many of those markets have emerged and are starting to gobble up more developed markets.


[00:11:03.11 @janchip] Places like India and China, Brazil, Afghanistan, Egypt, Bolivia. You name it, I've probably run a field study there.


[00:11:13.12 @craigmod] You've basically spent 17 years being a professional traveler because a lot of these projects aren't very


[00:11:20.38 @craigmod] long. Maybe you have a week, maybe you have two weeks, maybe you have a month if you're lucky.


[00:11:24.09 @craigmod] You have to go super deep into a culture that maybe you haven't been to before.


[00:11:28.28 @janchip] Yup.


[00:11:28.56 @craigmod] That could be vastly different from anything that you've experienced before,


[00:11:31.38 @craigmod] and you have to go deep in a way that's respectful,


[00:11:34.55 @craigmod] and make sure everyone that's involved in the project doesn't feel like they're being taken advantage of.


[00:11:39.00 @craigmod] But, you also get the information that you want to get from the folks who are participating.


[00:11:43.96 @craigmod] Then you made the transition of going completely independent a few years ago.


[00:11:48.19 @janchip] Then three and a half years ago I started my own studio, Studio D Radiodurans.


[00:11:53.81 @janchip] I'm continuing that work, but I do it for clients that I love.


[00:11:59.05 @craigmod] And who are these clients that you love?


[00:12:02.49 @janchip] Commercial, nonprofit and governmental.


[00:12:07.52 @janchip] There's a couple on the website, but to be honest we, frankly, it's actually much easier to conduct the work


[00:12:14.56 @janchip] when people don't know who the client is. I like to keep those relationships a little bit discrete.


[00:12:20.25 @janchip] There's a couple that the clients wanted to push out and they're on the website, StudioDRadiodurans.com.


[00:12:24.78 @craigmod] Just for those listening,


[00:12:28.86 @craigmod] it's funny I asked that because I just wanted to tease Jan because Jan doesn't even tell me in private who he's working.


[00:12:36.26 @craigmod] for. It's always some .. I mean, he's the ultimate client tease.


[00:12:42.42 @craigmod] He'll be like, "We just finished this amazing thing that I can't tell you anything about." I'm like, "Come on?


[00:12:48.77 @craigmod] We're at a whisky bar. Just tell me." "No, can't do it. You'll know.


[00:12:53.26 @craigmod] You'll know someday, Craig." That's the response I get.


[00:12:56.00 @janchip] There's two ways to know about the project.


[00:12:58.47 @janchip] One way is to be the client and the second one is to be hired onto the project.


[00:13:03.4 @janchip] Come work with us again and you'll be working on some fantastic things. That's part of the fun, right?


[00:13:07.3 @janchip] Is to work with people you respect..


[00:13:08.69 @craigmod] Mmm (affirmative)


[00:13:09.0 @craigmod] I certainly would like to invite you back.


[00:13:10.8 @craigmod] Yeah, thank you.


[00:13:11.7 @craigmod] You've basically, you've spent 17 years going deep into all these places and what was the,


[00:13:17.1 @craigmod] you've had one other book come out. What was that book?


[00:13:19.25 @janchip] That's called Hidden in Plain Sight and that was published by Harper Business.


[00:13:24.5 @janchip] That went through the formal book publishing process.


[00:13:29.42 @janchip] I mean, that was be approached by an agent and then assigned with an agent and then a year spent on writing a proposal.


[00:13:38.07 @janchip] Funny, a writer to work with as well because I didn't have enough time


[00:13:41.95 @janchip] and I'm not even convinced at that time I had the skills to work consistently.


[00:13:45.37 @janchip] Then, another year writing the book and then it, you hand it over, right?.


[00:13:50.26 @janchip] And nine months later it appears on the shelves and it's this slightly .. It's lovely to see it out there.


[00:13:56.5 @janchip] It did okay in the US. Nothing special.


[00:13:59.19 @janchip] Did pretty well in Japan, Taiwan and actually, strangely, became a best seller in South Korea.


[00:14:05.2 @craigmod] The trick is you only need to sell seven copies in South Korea to be a best seller.


[00:14:10.96 @janchip] Three.


[00:14:11.8 @craigmod] Three, okay. That's a little known cultural fact. No one in South Korea reads books.


[00:14:17.5 @craigmod] If you sell three, you're on the top of the list.


[00:14:19.64 @janchip] Yeah.


[00:14:20.0 @craigmod] What was that book about?


[00:14:23.47 @janchip] That book was about decoding culture,


[00:14:26.03 @janchip] but that was really about how to see the world differently by asking questions that are maybe a little unusual,


[00:14:33.99 @janchip] that you're not used to answering.


[00:14:35.35 @janchip] The kind of questions that you gave up answering when you turned 10 because you'd figured stuff out.


[00:14:41.05 @janchip] You don't, no longer saw the eye, the world through fresh eyes. For example, why don't people write in the shower?


[00:14:52.15 @janchip] Why do people go to the bathroom when they do, and not before or not after?


[00:14:57.23 @janchip] What compels us to have a particular kind of behavior?


[00:15:01.04 @janchip] These are really obvious questions, but when you delve into them, and you unpack them.


[00:15:05.85 @janchip] and you look at all the things around them and then you put them into a cultural context, you end up with this ..


[00:15:10.2 @janchip] You end up revealing things that you never really knew when you started out.


[00:15:15.79 @janchip] A lot of our clients they have, I mean, literally they're all washing data, right? They have tons of marketing data.


[00:15:22.15 @janchip] Increasing they have data analytics, they're live or near time data based on actually usage.


[00:15:28.82 @janchip] That tells them a lot about what people are doing and it tells them a huge amount about how they're doing it.


[00:15:34.45 @janchip] But really they're missing the, for me, the most important component, which is why people are behaving why they do.


[00:15:39.53 @janchip] For that you need to understand context. What I do when I run these projects is I help organizations understand why.


[00:15:47.27 @janchip] And fundamentally if you understand why, it can take you in a very,


[00:15:52.37 @janchip] very different direction than if you only understood what or how. That's the crux of it.


[00:15:59.2 @craigmod] If this first book is about figuring out how to get back to beginner's mind,


[00:16:03.9 @craigmod] approaching things with a set of seemingly obvious questions,


[00:16:07.5 @craigmod] but that help you get to the why of why people are doing stuff.


[00:16:09.9 @craigmod] Is The Field Study Handbook the how to go ask those whys, to get to those whys?


[00:16:16.00 @janchip] It's two things, yeah. One part of it is the how to.


[00:16:19.45 @janchip] Literally it will take you from the initial pitch of this is why I think we should invest in this kind of research to


[00:16:27.16 @janchip] helping form what we're doing in our organization or to a client. Through to running that project.


[00:16:32.96 @janchip] Through to figuring out how to build an international team, that you have a trusted relationship with,


[00:16:38.29 @janchip] that gives you a better opportunity of getting to the real crux of the matter or the, closer to the truth.


[00:16:44.78 @janchip] All the way through to delivering it and sharing it.


[00:16:48.54 @janchip] That process of sharing in such a way that you actually influence people around you.


[00:16:52.53 @janchip] You want to inform them and you also want to inspire them.


[00:16:55.35 @janchip] A lot of organizations have left reigns and right reigns and you have to appeal to both sides of it.


[00:17:00.58 @janchip] Literally, that's the how to. There's a lot of people particularly they put out kits.


[00:17:05.56 @janchip] Follow these five steps, you'll figure that stuff out.


[00:17:08.39 @janchip] But really I think it's missing the biggest component, which is how do you align your own intent,


[00:17:14.89 @janchip] how do you confront your own intent for why you want to do this? Because everyone wants to travel.


[00:17:18.54 @janchip] Nobody says no to it, right? Especially to interesting places.


[00:17:22.17 @janchip] How do you confront that, and how do you help understand what your organization's intent is


[00:17:29.06 @janchip] and how do you redirect that intent to something with a greater alignment to what people actually want and need?


[00:17:36.03 @janchip] Rather than just what the organization wants, thinks it wants and needs based on a different kind of data.


[00:17:42.48 @janchip] The why to, for me I don't think anyone's written a why to for this kind of stuff.


[00:17:47.9 @craigmod] A lot of these projects seem fraught with potential for ethically fuzzy stuff to happen.


[00:17:54.1 @craigmod] And, how do you think about that and how do you deal with that?


[00:17:57.19 @janchip] I've been practicing for many years, and I'm not saying there aren't logistical challenges to run it,


[00:18:01.9 @janchip] but probably the most interesting thing on any project is the ethical issues that you confront.


[00:18:09.32 @janchip] Because the world is very fuzzy and a lot of the places that I work have a very variable rule of law.


[00:18:17.56 @janchip] Sometimes the police are the most corrupt people there, or the most obviously corrupt institution.


[00:18:26.52 @janchip] We get hustled for bribes and shaken down.


[00:18:30.59 @janchip] We need to figure out what's going on, but we want to do


[00:18:35.16 @janchip] and we want to come out of it with a smile on our face for the right reasons, right?


[00:18:38.09 @janchip] For me the ethical component really starts, always starts with the local team.


[00:18:43.15 @janchip] When people hire us, or when people think about what we do is they think we decode culture, which we do.


[00:18:49.11 @janchip] But actually we decode culture and local cultures and for that we need a local team,


[00:18:54.6 @janchip] but we translate it to an organization and to a project.


[00:18:59.25 @janchip] If you don't understand that organization and if you can't speak the language of that organization, then you've failed.


[00:19:06.5 @janchip] We're really a bridge between the local culture and the organization and what they're trying to do.


[00:19:11.71 @janchip] The first part of that is building a local team that trusts you. It's not necessarily absolute trust.


[00:19:18.18 @janchip] Occasionally it is absolute trust, as in life and death trust. But for most projects it's a degree of trust.


[00:19:25.1 @craigmod] Can you give an example of a life and death trust situation?


[00:19:29.75 @janchip] Okay.


[00:19:31.92 @janchip] I can do, but let's start with a slightly more trivial one, which is when you land somewhere


[00:19:36.81 @janchip] and someone is showing you around and they're introducing you to their social network.


[00:19:43.13 @janchip] Their body language cues that they will make that introduction.


[00:19:46.97 @janchip] If they do not trust you, if there's any suspicion,


[00:19:49.98 @janchip] that will come through unconsciously in the way that they communicate with their peers


[00:19:54.82 @janchip] and their peers will pick up on it, or the neighborhood will pick up on it, right?.


[00:19:58.0 @craigmod] Mm-


[00:19:58.99 @janchip] You end up with a distorted view of things.


[00:20:04.56 @janchip] People may want to tell the truth, also, but they don't necessarily remember accurately,


[00:20:08.95 @janchip] so there's all these different ways of getting to this notion of truth. The question of higher risk places.


[00:20:16.45 @janchip] I think one of the projects in Afghanistan we had a local crew.


[00:20:21.00 @janchip] One of the local crew was offered a large sum of money to facilitate a kidnapping of one of my colleagues.


[00:20:27.85 @janchip] That's what I was told by the local crew. There are so many different ways that that could play out.


[00:20:33.47 @janchip] It may not have been true, that person may have been wanting to raise their profile.


[00:20:37.97 @janchip] I doubt it with the relationship that we had with them.


[00:20:40.71 @janchip] It may be that someone did make that offer, but they weren't going to follow through on it.


[00:20:44.52 @janchip] They may have been using it to blackmail person. If they'd accepted they may blackmail them.


[00:20:49.79 @janchip] It may be true and they might have killed that person.


[00:20:52.24 @janchip] The point being is in those situations where that kind of thing arises,


[00:20:57.99 @janchip] you want to make sure that there is a local person on the ground who puts you


[00:21:03.13 @janchip] and your team ahead of these other opportunities that may arise. You do that by building trust. How do you build trust?


[00:21:12.53 @janchip] Fundamental the world over, it's about showing respect from day one.


[00:21:16.9 @janchip] Also, earning respect in negotiating appropriately.


[00:21:24.07 @janchip] If you pay over the odds in Burundi for a guide, you'll be considered an idiot.


[00:21:28.57 @janchip] If you pay under the odds in Burundi for a guide you'll be considered an exploitative local.


[00:21:34.95 @janchip] And, there's a million and one interactions where it's actually very subtle about whether you can pull it off or not.


[00:21:43.7 @janchip] And all of those things go into a process of building trust.


[00:21:47.42 @janchip] Another thing that we do to build trust is we tend to hire a place, which we call a popup studio,


[00:21:52.84 @janchip] a live-


[00:21:58.23 @janchip] I strongly believe that a team that sits around the same table and drinks water from the same jug


[00:22:07.57 @janchip] and sits on the same toilet, or squats on the same toilet as well,


[00:22:11.26 @janchip] has a very different level of trust than one that meets in a hotel lobby in the morning and then goes out.


[00:22:17.6 @craigmod] Sure.


[00:22:18.56 @janchip] I mean, you've been in a popup studio, you've experienced some of that..


[00:22:23.6 @craigmod] Mm-


[00:22:24.34 @janchip] Right. That's one of the steps in building trust.


[00:22:30.2 @craigmod] Yeah, I think that's completely true.


[00:22:33.2 @craigmod] Would you say, just to bring up an example, a really banal example of how trust gets you closer to truth more quickly.


[00:22:43.0 @craigmod] I learned when I was working with your team out in Myanmar a year and a half ago.


[00:22:48.6 @craigmod] For example, you go into someone's home and you ask them,


[00:22:52.24 @craigmod] "How many times a day do you call your spouse?" They'll inevitably say something.


[00:22:59.79 @craigmod] "Two or three times." You say, "Can I just see your phone?


[00:23:02.79 @craigmod] Is that okay?" Having that trust where they're willing to give you their phone,


[00:23:08.18 @craigmod] where you can look at their call records


[00:23:11.19 @craigmod] and then looking at the call records you realize it's totally not what they thought the number was.


[00:23:16.7 @craigmod] It's like getting to that truth of living, experience culture


[00:23:22.71 @craigmod] or whatever is completely contingent on having that trust.


[00:23:26.63 @craigmod] And building that trust in the case of going to someone's home within minutes, right?


[00:23:30.88 @janchip] It may seem like it's within minutes,


[00:23:33.16 @janchip] but really you've built trust with a layer around that home with other people who have that established relationship.


[00:23:39.71 @craigmod] Right.


[00:23:40.56 @janchip] Really, the book shows you how to build a team anywhere in the world with a sufficient level of trust.


[00:23:50.27 @janchip] It isn't a thing that you can just go out, read the book and go out tomorrow and it's all going to work.


[00:23:54.25 @janchip] It takes a lot of practice to read social situations. This isn't a become a researcher in the next hour, book.


[00:24:03.2 @janchip] This is a what direction do you want your life to take?


[00:24:08.06 @janchip] If you want to decode and understand the world out there, I will give you the tools


[00:24:12.83 @janchip] and I think a ethical framework in which to approach that.


[00:24:18.23 @janchip] And it'll be very, you will, I believe your life will be more rewarding for it.


[00:24:22.53 @janchip] Mine one certainly has been,


[00:24:24.06 @janchip] and I think through the work that I've conducted I think we've impacted quite a few people.


[00:24:28.84 @craigmod] And even if you're not doing work,


[00:24:32.15 @craigmod] even if you're just traveling on your own there is something tremendously powerful about this text


[00:24:39.8 @craigmod] and all of the lessons that you have put into this.


[00:24:44.37 @craigmod] In the sense of if you're traveling alone and you're going to a country, there is a skillset totally,


[00:24:52.81 @craigmod] it's totally a skillset to go deep in a way that is meaningful, that is not superficial,.


[00:25:00.46 @craigmod] that is getting off the beaten paths in interesting, non .. I don't know how to say this.


[00:25:08.04 @craigmod] But, getting off the beaten paths in a way that isn't obsessive about getting off the beaten paths.


[00:25:13.15 @craigmod] That is more of a natural flow into the culture, into a different country.


[00:25:18.81 @craigmod] One of the great gifts of this book is sharing that.


[00:25:23.17 @craigmod] Sharing those small, little insights about making yourself a better traveler, a better person, a better global citizen.


[00:25:32.99 @craigmod] What's also cool about this book is that it's a self published enterprise.


[00:25:37.36 @janchip] It is.


[00:25:39.16 @janchip] Not only that, the reason why it came into being is six years ago you published Art Space Tokyo


[00:25:48.6 @janchip] and I was so impressed with a human being going through the process of creating this beautiful, tangible object.


[00:25:56.43 @janchip] And you did such a great write up of the backstory to that, that I thought it was possible.


[00:26:03.99 @janchip] That was six years ago and I was just starting writing Hidden in Plain Sight.


[00:26:10.92 @janchip] Those two years of that process I was taking notes for The Field Study Handbook


[00:26:14.93 @janchip] and then after those two years I've spent four years,


[00:26:17.42 @janchip] pretty much every day four years working on this book with a goal of publishing it myself.


[00:26:22.64 @craigmod] Part of the impetus was reading the Kickstarter essay about self publishing and the accessibility of it.


[00:26:29.06 @craigmod] and things like that. Then, was there anything about the last process that you didn't like that you wanted to ..


[00:26:36.94 @craigmod] Pushing it through the traditional machine, was there something that you didn't find comfortable about that?


[00:26:42.41 @janchip] First off I've got to say I'm very grateful for my editor and Simon the writer and the team involved.


[00:26:51.53 @janchip] That said, and I learned a lot from the process. I learned about whether you can take credit for success, in a way.


[00:27:02.22 @janchip] It might sound weird, because there's so many people involved in the process.


[00:27:04.82 @craigmod] Sure.


[00:27:05.34 @janchip] And whether you should take responsibility for failure as well if it doesn't do well in a market.


[00:27:12.95 @janchip] But really once the book was finished and it was handed over, it just felt like it belonged to someone else.


[00:27:18.84 @janchip] When the sales started I didn't really get a sense of impetus or feedback.


[00:27:27.47 @janchip] Since that book came out I actually published a couple of ebooks, PDFs you can download from the site.


[00:27:32.28 @janchip] I actually have a closer relationship to the people who purchased that because I get a little ding,


[00:27:37.81 @janchip] "This human being has invested $4.99 in spending time on something that you've written." That commitment to an idea


[00:27:47.15 @janchip] and spending time is more meaningful to me than a royalty, an advance on a book or a royalty check.


[00:27:55.21 @janchip] With the Hidden, sorry, with The Field Study Handbook I wanted to be much closer to that process.


[00:28:00.68 @craigmod] Right, and probably in having done one, I think it's important for people to push a,


[00:28:07.67 @craigmod] pushing a book through a traditional system, I think, is you learn a lot.


[00:28:11.68 @craigmod] I also think that it's easy to poo-


[00:28:14.56 @craigmod] It's easy today to say, "Everyone should self publish." Or, "Everyone, forget the big five, or whatever, the big six,


[00:28:21.82 @craigmod] big four." Whatever they've consolidated down to, now.


[00:28:26.56 @craigmod] It's easy to say those things, but I think there's,


[00:28:28.27 @craigmod] first of all there's tremendous value in traditional publishing systems.


[00:28:32.73 @craigmod] For certain kinds of books it's really unbeatable.


[00:28:35.81 @craigmod] And for getting to certain corners of certain markets it's almost impossible to do on your own as an indie publisher.


[00:28:42.62 @craigmod] Also, if you are lucky enough to not need an advance, if you have other work that you're able to use to,


[00:28:50.81 @craigmod] that doesn't take up 100% of your time and gives you a little bit of time.


[00:28:53.17 @craigmod] You've done an incredible job, I think,


[00:28:54.91 @craigmod] of creating space in your life to work on The Field Study Handbook despite having every excuse in the world not to be


[00:29:00.82 @craigmod] doing it.


[00:29:01.64 @craigmod] If you have that self discipline and you don't need the advances and things like that,


[00:29:05.12 @craigmod] then I think it can be wonderful. Now that you have, you're on the cusp of putting this thing out into the world.


[00:29:14.23 @craigmod] In fact,


[00:29:14.64 @craigmod] you're so on the cusp that you just came back from somewhere a couple days ago where you were looking at something


[00:29:20.98 @craigmod] connected to the book. Do you want to talk about that?


[00:29:22.65 @janchip] Sure. Yeah. I've just come back from Iceland.


[00:29:26.54 @janchip] I [inaudible 00:29:27] the book and reached out to a number of printers in the US, Canada and Iceland.


[00:29:33.36 @janchip] Iceland just felt like the right fit. It's Oddi Printing in Reykjavik.


[00:29:39.18 @janchip] I've just come back from a four day trip to Iceland. That was fun.


[00:29:43.05 @craigmod] Nice. Actually, Oddi was the printer of the first book that I ever designed myself.


[00:29:48.16 @janchip] Oh, really?


[00:29:48.46 @craigmod] Yeah.


[00:29:49.39 @craigmod] Kuhaku was the first book that I worked on


[00:29:53.12 @craigmod] and they were printed at Oddi because Oddi was the printer that McSweeney's used for the most part.


[00:30:00.93 @craigmod] And back in the early 2000s, late '90s,


[00:30:05.29 @craigmod] if you were doing any kind of indie-


[00:30:11.48 @craigmod] We stalked them and stalked their colophons and copyright pages and were like,


[00:30:17.5 @craigmod] "Where are they doing these things?" Yeah, ended up going to Oddi as well.


[00:30:21.6 @craigmod] It's funny, it's almost like a rite of passage to go have something printed in Iceland..


[00:30:26.51 @craigmod] They're the only printer in Iceland, right? Aren't they the ..


[00:30:30.59 @janchip] No, there's a couple of other much smaller printers.


[00:30:35.87 @janchip] They were very accommodating and created this beautiful mock-


[00:30:41.14 @craigmod] Speaking of beautiful, I mean this is a gorgeous looking book. Can you explain the cover a little bit?


[00:30:47.28 @janchip] The book is illustrated by Lee John Phillips who's a technical illustrator in Narberth, Wales.


[00:30:54.43 @janchip] He's incredibly talented. You should Lee John Phillips on Instagram and you'll see what I mean.


[00:30:58.8 @janchip] We took one of his pictures, which was a garlic bulb and we blew it up.


[00:31:03.51 @janchip] In blowing it up it feels like a contoural map of a mountain or something like that.


[00:31:09.57 @janchip] I wanted to have something that survived the squint test. You look at it and you're not quite sure..


[00:31:16.42 @janchip] Like, "Is that a landscape? Is that a ..


[00:31:19.23 @janchip] " Then when you open the book itself you'll see that there is the smaller,


[00:31:24.96 @janchip] finer version of that exact [inaudible 00:31:27] in all its technical penmanship beauty.


[00:31:30.79 @craigmod] I mean, that's the thing these illustrations, it has to be said. You just want to lick the pages.


[00:31:37.77 @craigmod] I mean, they have that, it's that Wall Street Journal dot pattern style, but with more pizazz


[00:31:43.98 @craigmod] and a little more of the human hand involved. They just look gorgeous.


[00:31:49.28 @craigmod] I mean they're the sort of thing that a filter couldn't do justice to with a photograph.


[00:31:55.52 @craigmod] But this man in Wales he does magic with his black and white lines. It's pretty incredible.


[00:32:02.56 @craigmod] And you have a hit of color on the cover as well.


[00:32:05.59 @janchip] Yeah, there's a little splash of color. Originally we were thinking of just selling through Amazon.


[00:32:12.95 @janchip] We'll drop ship from Oddi's warehouse in Maine where they ship things to import them to the US,


[00:32:20.6 @janchip] through to the Amazon warehouse and put it on sale there..


[00:32:23.03 @janchip] Yeah, there's a special color and I think part of the reason was that we wanted it ..


[00:32:27.42 @janchip] Or we, I'm sorry, I'm working with my creative director here in the studio Keiko Mori.


[00:32:33.49 @janchip] We wanted it to survive the squint test on Amazon. We wanted it to work in a thumbnail.


[00:32:41.39 @janchip] I think some of the, like if you think of Koya Bound, your own book,


[00:32:45.12 @janchip] that's quite a subtle book to put on a Amazon page and have distinctive in a lineup.


[00:32:52.93 @janchip] That little splash of color is to make it a little bit more distinctive,


[00:32:56.65 @janchip] especially across different kind of collateral.


[00:32:58.57 @craigmod] I think it looks great.


[00:33:00.2 @janchip] Thank you.


[00:33:00.88 @craigmod] Yeah. I mean, and what font are you using on the cover there?


[00:33:05.00 @janchip] That one we definitely, definitely ripped off Art Space Tokyo.


[00:33:09.72 @janchip] It is Fedra, Fedra Sans Standard and Fedra Serif Standard. We also used condensed on the diagrams.


[00:33:19.9 @craigmod] Fedra, I mean, I love Fedra.


[00:33:21.74 @craigmod] I mean,


[00:33:22.01 @craigmod] when I was doing lots of book design 10 years ago I had these moments where I'd just spend weeks going through every


[00:33:30.76 @craigmod] font I could possibly find. And Fedra was the family that I committed to.


[00:33:36.84 @craigmod] I married Fedra, basically as a book designer. Koya Bound is also Fedra.


[00:33:40.95 @janchip] Oh, is it?


[00:33:42.95 @craigmod] Yeah. I use Fedra for everything and I'm not ashamed of it. It's so good. It's so beautiful.


[00:33:52.66 @craigmod] It's a beautiful, distinctive, highly readable, but has its own character but doesn't overwhelm the page.


[00:33:58.29 @craigmod] It's just feels great. It's from Typotheque over in, I think the Netherlands.


[00:34:02.58 @janchip] That's correct, yeah.


[00:34:04.45 @craigmod] Yeah.


[00:34:05.23 @janchip] Actually it does a great job in supporting different character sets as well.


[00:34:10.26 @janchip] They've really internationalized it.


[00:34:11.54 @craigmod] Yeah. It's wonderful. I think you should think about doing a Kickstarter for this thing.


[00:34:17.95 @craigmod] I mean, it just feels, because you also run, you run a luggage company.


[00:34:21.54 @craigmod] It just feels like there's such an obvious confluence between the amazing gear that you're producing


[00:34:27.48 @craigmod] and what this book entices people to go do in the world.


[00:34:30.68 @janchip] Yeah, maybe a little context of that.


[00:34:33.22 @janchip] When I was starting the book,


[00:34:36.27 @janchip] around the same time I was commissioned a custom piece of luggage for the kind of travel I do.


[00:34:42.01 @janchip] Basically I want to be able to carry stuff, sometimes a lot of expensive stuff,


[00:34:45.93 @janchip] and actually sometimes a lot of cash because we have to pay payroll for a team of 20 people


[00:34:51.99 @janchip] or however many people in cash sometimes.


[00:34:54.66 @craigmod] And you might be in a place, and you'll be in a place that has no banks or ATMs..


[00:34:58.28 @janchip] Yes, but a lot of people with sticky fingers and a lot of checkpoints and ..


[00:35:04.11 @janchip] I wanted a piece of luggage that basically people ignored and would be less likely to be pulled aside at checkpoints


[00:35:11.51 @janchip] and check-


[00:35:17.49 @janchip] I designed a piece of luggage, it's called the D3. it's a duffle.


[00:35:20.54 @janchip] It's made from this ultra light, amazing ultralight material called Dyneema. It's a particular, a blend of that.


[00:35:25.84 @janchip] It's about twice the strength of Kevlar, or if you want to put it another way,


[00:35:29.4 @janchip] half the weight of Kevlar for the same tensile strength. It floats in water, it's that light as well.


[00:35:34.43 @janchip] I made a piece of luggage for that, and then a year later I made another prototype


[00:35:39.01 @janchip] and then people like yourself saw it and said, "Hey, can I have one?" I made 10


[00:35:43.17 @janchip] and there were 10 beta testers of which you were one.


[00:35:46.86 @janchip] I remember you feeding back in the report into the D3 owner's manual, which we had online, this big Google Doc.


[00:35:53.43 @janchip] This was before it was a company, or even decided, before I decided to even sell it.


[00:35:57.36 @janchip] Then, three and a bit years ago I launched it as a luggage brand and we make duffels


[00:36:04.66 @janchip] and travel accessories for field work.


[00:36:08.86 @janchip] One of the things that we're going to do for the launch of the book is introduce a couple of new items,


[00:36:14.36 @janchip] specifically for field work.


[00:36:17.35 @janchip] If you buy the book and you like to get out there and take notes and figure out what's going on in the world out there,


[00:36:22.89 @janchip] and document it, have I got something for you.


[00:36:25.7 @craigmod] Nice..


[00:36:27.5 @janchip] I mean, I think the D3. that piece of luggage is a great example of from the outside you look at it and you go ..


[00:36:34.93 @janchip] You have the D3 and then you have this other thing, you have this other thing called the Hauly.


[00:36:38.75 @janchip] It's like it holds a million dollars in used $20 dollar bills. Just enough sized.


[00:36:44.46 @janchip] From the outside you look at it, you go, "This is for drug cartels in South America.


[00:36:48.99 @janchip] What's this?" But, no,


[00:36:50.31 @janchip] you have literally been in the field in places where there aren't lots of ATMs where you have to pay a bunch of people


[00:36:58.78 @janchip] a bunch of cash out in the field and you have to be carrying the equivalent of a million dollars.


[00:37:04.18 @janchip] This comes out of that need. I love that.


[00:37:07.36 @janchip] There are people who have jobs where they need to carry a lot of cash.


[00:37:11.14 @janchip] It's actually not used 20s, it's used or new $100 dollar bills.


[00:37:16.32 @craigmod] Okay, 20s would be insane.


[00:37:18.7 @janchip] It would be insane. It would be five times the weight.


[00:37:22.31 @craigmod] Yes. Yeah, but that piece of luggage as being born directly from a real need in the field.


[00:37:31.18 @craigmod] Then, this book as being an enticement into the field and that piece of luggage as existing feels like a cool,


[00:37:39.58 @craigmod] I don't know. I can just see the Kickstarter campaign that's like, "Get the book and the luggage. They go together."


[00:37:43.99 @janchip] And maybe similar to yourself is if you do interesting work,


[00:37:48.81 @janchip] and you interact with people who are living interesting lives,


[00:37:53.33 @janchip] it tends to generate its own momentum for new interesting things.


[00:37:58.44 @janchip] Things to keep you engaged and pushing you at the boundary of the craft.


[00:38:02.33 @janchip] I think with the luggage in creating these things,


[00:38:06.54 @janchip] we ended up with attracting conversations from people who are pushing the boundaries.


[00:38:12.91 @janchip] They are in places where they are carrying a million bucks and they want to have that additional protection.


[00:38:17.51 @craigmod] Who do you think the audience is for this Field Study Handbook?


[00:38:21.56 @craigmod] Do you think it's like, is it a designer in a startup in Silicon Valley??


[00:38:26.98 @craigmod] It is someone who's working for a think tank in Washington D.C. Is it someone who's an independent consultant?


[00:38:34.46 @craigmod] Who's the people that you're trying to touch with this book?


[00:38:37.55 @janchip] The Field Study Handbook is for anyone that wants to understand what is going on in the world.


[00:38:44.46 @janchip] Most of the people who currently practice that are designers, strategists, they're in brand, communications,


[00:38:51.00 @janchip] public policy partnerships.


[00:38:52.91 @janchip] Because the emphasis on the handbook is about international research,


[00:38:57.3 @janchip] it really will support anyone who is creating anything that is used beyond their boarders.


[00:39:03.64 @janchip] They have to think beyond what they know and I give them the tools


[00:39:07.29 @janchip] and the techniques to be able to go beyond their boarders and bring that into their organization, into their work life.


[00:39:14.67 @janchip] That's on one level. I think there's another thing.


[00:39:16.53 @janchip] I think it's for anyone who is a traveler, who wishes to travel


[00:39:22.09 @janchip] and who wishes to understand more about the places that they travel to.


[00:39:27.7 @janchip] They want to have a richer, more rewarding travel experience. In that sense it's for everyone, I think.


[00:39:34.17 @craigmod] But this feels like a book for living in the future. It feels like the inevitable direction we're moving in.


[00:39:43.84 @craigmod] Is one of a more globalized universe,


[00:39:46.77 @craigmod] globalized earth where more cultures are interacting with other cultures than ever before in the history of humanity.


[00:39:55.83 @craigmod] Despite recent nationalist tendencies, the future pattern is inexorably globalized living.


[00:40:05.18 @craigmod] This book feels like a blueprint for living in that future.


[00:40:10.07 @craigmod] And that if you work in any industry that touches the world, you are going to get value from it.


[00:40:15.4 @janchip] Yes. It's a book for coexisting.


[00:40:18.84 @craigmod] It's a book from the future about an ideal,.


[00:40:23.46 @craigmod] the utopian version of where the world could possibly [crosstalk 00:40:27]


[00:40:27.99 @janchip] You say utopian, but it's not dystopian, but it isn't that shiny utopian thing.


[00:40:35.67 @craigmod] Sure.


[00:40:36.44 @janchip] That vision, it's a very messy and beautiful and gloopy, dusty, touchy feely, snotty,


[00:40:46.74 @janchip] version of the world. It's the real world.


[00:40:48.35 @craigmod] When I say utopian I mean in the sense of this is the utopian traveler.


[00:40:52.44 @craigmod] This is the idea traveler is someone who thinks about the world in this way,


[00:40:56.92 @craigmod] approaches other cultures with this respect and openness and open mind and open heart and is curious and hungry.


[00:41:05.78 @craigmod] It's a book without malice.


[00:41:08.05 @craigmod] The world can be messy and the world will be messy, but it feels like it's a handbook that comes from a kind place.


[00:41:16.48 @craigmod] When I say utopian I think my goal, I think it'd be ideal if everyone approached the world from this kind of place.


[00:41:24.63 @craigmod] I don't know. It seems like a good stake in the ground..


[00:41:26.13 @janchip] Yeah. And we've costed, actually, to be as ..


[00:41:30.12 @janchip] It's pretty hefty and print costs are pretty high, but we've costed it to be as accessible as possible.


[00:41:34.97 @craigmod] Will it ever be released just digitally? For now it's only in print, right?


[00:41:38.26 @janchip] It's only in hardback and I just devoted all my energy and my family's energy


[00:41:44.32 @janchip] and the studio's energy into getting it to this place.


[00:41:49.95 @janchip] I'm just going to put it out there and see the reaction to it and then figure out what I want to do next.


[00:41:55.58 @craigmod] I think this is the right sequence because artifacts, printed things, stuff that you can hold in your hand,


[00:42:02.26 @craigmod] things that you can hold in your hand have a certain power about setting intentions


[00:42:06.5 @craigmod] and also about being present in someone's life.


[00:42:08.94 @craigmod] A book sitting on a table is going to call someone to try something far more frequently than a PDF lost in a folder


[00:42:17.14 @craigmod] or a Kindle book lost on a Kindle that's sitting in a drawer or something like that.


[00:42:22.23 @craigmod] I think it's a great place to start from the artifact.


[00:42:25.73 @craigmod] Then I'm definitely doing to push you to open this up in many different ways eventually either though websites,


[00:42:32.14 @craigmod] super accessible websites or digital downloads or digital education stuff.


[00:42:37.56 @craigmod] I'm going to push very hard for that in the future, but I think this is a great starting point.


[00:42:42.25 @janchip] My studio does offer training for organizations.


[00:42:46.47 @janchip] I mean, we do run field research around the world, as well.


[00:42:49.71 @janchip] You can hire us in if you want to run a larger scale project.


[00:42:55.00 @janchip] I mean, some of the, one of the things that I enjoyed about Art Space Tokyo was when you put it out in the world,


[00:43:01.21 @janchip] there was the backstory to it.


[00:43:04.32 @janchip] That was such a rich component, particularly at that time where that wasn't so widely available


[00:43:08.87 @janchip] and wasn't so necessarily beautifully articulated. With The Field Study Handbook there's a number of components to it.


[00:43:15.41 @janchip] There's the luggage component and the field study accessories component, which comes from our own luggage brand.


[00:43:23.52 @janchip] There's training and workshops. I mean, that's there too.


[00:43:26.92 @janchip] There's things like wallpaper downloads for Lee's beautiful illustrations.


[00:43:33.22 @janchip] Then there's a second smaller book called Sustainable Data.


[00:43:38.12 @janchip] I believe that's the only book that could be filed under the Library of Congress under Data, Ethics, Gardening


[00:43:45.47 @janchip] and Cookery.


[00:43:46.18 @craigmod] A book is a start of this constellation of work and connections and interactions and discussions.


[00:43:54.69 @craigmod] It sounds like there's a bunch of cool stuff coming out connected with this.


[00:43:57.6 @janchip] Yeah, I mean ultimately it all comes back to conversations that it starts, right?


[00:44:03.11 @craigmod] Yeah.


[00:44:03.58 @janchip] And what those conversations lead to in terms of a life lived and journeys undertaking.


[00:44:10.71 @janchip] People that we love and feel close to, right?


[00:44:12.69 @craigmod] A life well lived.


[00:44:14.13 @janchip] Yeah. Who can ask for anything more?


[00:44:17.07 @craigmod] Great. Thank you, Jan, for making the time today to chat.


[00:44:20.54 @janchip] Thank you, Craig, for having me on your podcast.


[00:44:23.71 @craigmod] Yeah.


[00:44:24.24 @janchip] What is the podcast called, by the way?


[00:44:26.36 @craigmod] It's called Let's Talk About Books.


[00:44:28.52 @janchip] Okay. Did we talk about books? Yeah, I guess we did a bit.


[00:44:33.11 @craigmod] We'll have links to all this stuff down below and wherever below


[00:44:38.67 @craigmod] or above wherever it lives in whatever thing you're listening to this in. How do you end these things?


[00:44:45.72 @janchip] I think you need a jingle.


[00:44:47.79 @craigmod] We're done.
